# CS359B Project: OceanFund

OceanFund contains investment pools where users can store money. While the investor has their money in, they get an x% interest when someone else liquidates their interest. 

If you enter at time T_0 and leave at time T_1, you will earn (# of investors who liquidated in that time frame) * x% return on your investment.
